pi Tables
========= 
  
All entries were compared with the extensive prime sieve tables of Tomás Oliveira e Silva and Jan Büthe, where available.<br/>
Most entries were double checked, so I'm quite confident that the results are correct.

  
Table            | pi(x) generated with | li(x) generated with
------------------- | -------- | --------
  1d09	| program LingSieve of myself	| boost
  1d10	| previous table	| boost

  1d17 	| previous table	| primecount
  1d18 	| previous table	| primecount
  1d19 	| program primecount of Kim Walisch (purple/white)	| primecount
  1d20 	| previous table	| primecount
  1d21 	| previous table	| primecount
  1d22 	| previous table	| primecount
  1d23 	| program primecount of Kim Walisch	(pink/white) | primecount
  1d24 	| previous table	| primecount
  
  
  li Tables
  ========= 
  
  Tables 19 .. 35 were generated with primecount (gold/white)<br/>
  Tables 36 .. xx were generated with wolframalpha (pink/white)
  
  
  Status
  ======
  
  Basic development is finished, tables hold 33 million records and counting ...<br/>
  Program with DB can't be uploaded, even in zipped form it exceeds 290MB, whereas GitHub allows 25MB only.<br/>
  After emptying tables d11 and d12 and truncating all li tables the program size is small enough to be uploaded.
