# PrimeBrowser
As the title says, you can browse prime number tables conviniently with a graphical UI.
All entries were compared with the extensive prime sieve tables of Tomás Oliveira e Silva and Jan Büthe, where available
All other entries were double checked, so I'm quite confident that they are correct.
