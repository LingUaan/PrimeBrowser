# PrimeBrowser
As the title says, you can browse prime number tables conviniently with a graphical UI.


Usage
=====

  Download the program, unzip it anywhere and run it by clicking the program item.


 Tables
  ====== 
  
  All entries were compared with the extensive prime sieve tables of Tomás Oliveira e Silva and Jan Büthe, where available.<br/>
All other entries were double checked, so I'm quite confident that they are correct.

  
Table            | Comment
------------------- | --------
  1d09	| generated with program LingSieve of myself
  1d10	| computed from previous table
  1d11 	| generated with program LingSieve of myself (blue/white)
  1d12 	| computed from previous table
  1d13 	| computed from previous table
  1d14 	| computed from previous table
  1d15 	| generated with program primecount of Kim Walisch (green/white)
  1d16 	| computed from previous table
  1d17 	| computed from previous table
  1d18 	| computed from previous table
  1d19 	| generated with program primecount of Kim Walisch (grey/white)
  1d20 	| computed from previous table
  1d21 	| computed from previous table
  1d22 	| computed from previous table
  1d23 	| generated with program primecount of Kim Walisch (grey/white)

  Status
  ======
  
  Basic development is finished, tables hold more than 10 million records and counting ...<br/>
  Program with DB cann't be uploaded, because even in zipped form it exceeds 170MB, whereas GitHub allows 25MB only.
  After emptying tables d11 and d12 the program size is small enough to be uploade.
